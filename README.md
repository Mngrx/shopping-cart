# Shopping cart application

## About

It is an API to serve an Shopping Cart service and a CRUD for Products.

## How to run

## TODO

- To restructure the tests that interact with Redis to have more concise assertions in data inserts and retrieval operations
- To improve validations during the `Shopping Cart Checkout`. For example, validate if a product still active.
- To improve the way the system deal with avaibility of databases services (MySQL and Redis). Currently, it is just returning 500 error for the user.
